# Minishell
This proyect is about developing a shell. It's a portion of a real shell regularly called "minishell". This poryect is a good
put in practice some of the most importan call in a operating sysyem like, "fork", "exec", "signal", "pipe", "dup" and more.

Also is a Makefile is programed to facilite the execution and the use of the compiler gcc.



## Getting Started

This project was inspired to make easier the billing of the consumption of each month of cloud services, in this case AWS. 
It was needed to extract manually from the pdf invoices to account for some credits AWs gives.

So this script was created to eliminate this manual search avoding long efforts extracting this data, human error and saving time.

### Prerequisites

You will use it a UNIX operating system.

Any text editor, built-in in most UNIX system.

Gcc compiler, also built-in in most UNIX system.

So no worries for any installation :wink:

## Running

Open your terminal where the files(main.c and Makefile) are.

Type:
```
make
```
this will generate two files, main.o and minishel.

Then type:
```
./minishel
```
and that's it you have your minishel running and ready for testing. :sunglasses:
